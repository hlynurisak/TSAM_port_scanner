The dark side of network programming is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be...unnatural. I am an evil port, I will only communicate with evil processes! (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_bit)
Send us a message of 4 bytes containing the signature that you created with S.E.C.R.E.T

Greetings! I am E.X.P.S.T.N, which stands for "Enhanced X-link Port Storage Transaction Node".

What can I do for you? 
- If you provide me with a list of secret ports (comma-separated), I can guide you on the exact sequence of "knocks" to ensure you score full marks.

How to use E.X.P.S.T.N?
1. Each "knock" must be paired with both a secret phrase and your unique S.E.C.R.E.T signature.
2. The correct format to send a knock: First, 4 bytes containing your S.E.C.R.E.T signature, followed by the secret phrase.

Tip: To discover the secret ports and their associated phrases, start by solving challenges on the ports detected using your port scanner. Happy hunting!

Greetings from S.E.C.R.E.T (Secure Encryption Certification Relay with Enhanced Trust)! Here's how to access the secret port I'm safeguarding:
1. Send me your group number as a single unsigned byte.
2. I'll reply with a 4-byte challenge (in network byte order) unique to your group.
3. Sign this challenge using the XOR operation with your group's secret (get that from your TA).
4. Reply with a 5-byte message: the first byte is your group number, followed by the 4-byte signed challenge (in network byte order).
5. If your signature is correct, I'll grant you access to the port. Good luck!

Send me a 4-byte message containing the signature you got from S.E.C.R.E.T in the first 4 bytes (in network byte order).
